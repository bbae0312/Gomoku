## How to Play

Gomoku is a two-player strategy game played on a 19x19 board. The goal is to get five of your stones in a row before your opponent does. Here’s how to play:

1. **Start the Game**: Run `main.py` to start the game. The game board will appear with a 19x19 grid.

2. **Place a Stone**: Click on an intersection of lines on the board to place your stone. The black player goes first.

3. **Take Turns**: Players take turns placing one stone on the board per turn.

4. **Win the Game**: The first player to get five of their stones in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

Enjoy the game and may the best player win!

## Game Rules

1. **First Turn**: Black plays first.

2. **One Stone per Turn**: Players can only place one stone on the board per turn.

3. **Winning**: To win, a player must get five of their own stones in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

4. **No Overlines**: Getting more than five stones in a row does not count as a win.

5. **Draw**: If the board is filled and neither player has five in a row, the game is a draw.

6. **Respect and Fair Play**: Please be respectful to your opponent and play fairly. Enjoy the game!
